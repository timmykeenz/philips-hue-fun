# Philips Hue Fun
Uses pHue libary to create some fun Philips Hue light automation.  These are some very simple and inefficient scripts that control the lights in my house.  This project is here to keep track of all my interesting automations I come up with.  Check out the library here https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue.  Here are the following light shows available:
- Basic fireplace that flickers the lights and adjusts color temperature
- Dining room run that makes the lights chase each other in a circle
- Basement landing strip imitates airplane runway lights
- Color temperature fades between the colors temperatures the ambience bulbs offer
- Seizure light does exactly what is sounds like.  Flickers lights on and off rapidly.
